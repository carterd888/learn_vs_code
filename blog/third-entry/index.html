        <h2>What did i learn today?</h2>
   <p>today i tried to move a website from CodePen to GitHub</p>
   <p>the instructions seemed simple enough until "put the contents of a zip folder in a git GitHub repository</p>
   <p>after some trial and error and googling i came across this helpful link</p>
   <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1412078/bring-a-local-folder-to-remote-git-repo" target="_blank">This is a the site i found</a>
   <p>i managed to get very far following this until step 9 where i encounted an error</p>
   <img id="rejectedError" src="./rejected error.jpg" alt="error saying the push failed">
   <p>the help file referenced was extremely hard to follow so i went back to the existing webpage i found the steps on and looked at the comments to see if others had my problem</p>
   <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5509543/how-do-i-properly-force-a-git-push" target="_blank">This is the site i found</a>
   <p>i figured out the reason i was having all these errors was when i set up the repository i initialised it with a README file</p>
   <p>by doing this i had prevented any transfer of files as my local folder was seen as "out of date"</p>
   <img id="force" src="./force.jpg" alt="used command to force the push">
   <p>as the file in the existing GitHub repository was of no value i forced through the push of my files to GitHub</p>
    </br>
    <p>as this took me a long time to resolve and i knew others would be in a similar situation, i decided to retrace my steps and document it</p>
    <p>i came up with a file that i hope will be of use and makes me proud to have created</p>
