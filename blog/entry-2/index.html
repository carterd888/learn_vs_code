        <h2>What did i learn today?</h2>
        <p>today we had our class and talks from professionals about personal development and soft skills</p>
        <p>our coding practical today was using Git Desktop</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="./git-desktop.jpg" alt="logo for Git Desktop">
            <figcaption>The figure shows the logo for Git Desktop</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>on this platform we accessed a shared repository and took turns to edit a file and fetch and pull updates</p>
        <p>after the session i continued to update my blog from a few days ago, by solving a problem i was facing.</p>
        <p>the image i used on the first blog entry with the div issue was used to highlight the purple background only
            being displayed at the top of page</p>
        <p>however due to the page background also being purple this did not display correctly</p>
        <p>i tried to enter a border to the image using border: black </p>
        <p>this did not show up and i was worried i had not referenced the css tag correctly</p>
        <p>i decided to inspect the source code and found they were linked correctly</p>
        <p>i then did a google search to check the syntax i used</p>
        <a href="https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-add-border-to-image-in-css.html" target="_blank">This is the
            site i found</a>
        <p>i solved the issue by defining the colour as "solid black"</p>
