        <h2>What did i learn today?</h2>
        <p>today i wanted to improve the navigation between my blog pages</p>
        <p>i first changed the links on the blog page to the dates of enteries instead of a numbered system first,
            second etc.</p>
        <p>this will help to identify each blog as the page expands</p>
        <hr>
        <p>my next idea was to include a way to move between the pages, based on which page you are on</p>
        <p>i did some reasearch into this and it looked easier than i had anticipated using a similar method to my "nav
            bar"</p>
        <p>because this would be a big change effecting many pages i decided to make a branch from my origin named
            "nav-scroll"</p>
        <p>i used the terminal in visual studio code to do this as i had some previous experience</p>
        <quote>" git checkout -b nav-scroll "</quote>
        <p>i first reseached the buttons themselves, my initial idea would be to use directional arrows "<" and ">" </p>
                <p>however i later decided this was not explicit enough in what they did so i added the text "Previous"
                    and "Next"</p>
                <p>i used this site to structure my CSS for the buttons</p>
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_next_prev.asp" target="_blank"
                    alt="a link to w3schools next/previous buttons">See site here</a>
                <hr>
                <p>my first issue was that i had previous CSS to style a tags and as i placed this CSS further down my
                    page it was overriden</p>
                <p>to combat this i added a div tag around the navigation links with a class of next-previous and
                    refered to this as the parent selector of my CSS styling for a tag</p>
                <figure>
                    <img id="divNextPrevious" src="div-class-next-previous.jpg" alt="a div class surrounds the links">
                    <figcaption>a div class is created as a parent of the anchor tags to separate them from any other
                        CSS
                        styling</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <img id="nextPrevious" src="next-previous.jpg" alt="css containing parent class before a tag">
                    <figcaption>The CSS reads ".next-previous a" as opposed to just a </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>this allowed me to uniquely style these links and not affect any existing links</p>
                <p>i edited the CSS to keep with the ongoing theme of my site with text and colours </p>
                <hr>
                <p>once i was happy with the changes i had to push the changes and create a pull request</p>
                <p>i used the terminal again to initiate this with</p>
                <quote>"git push --set-upstream origin nav-scroll"</quote>
                <p>then i managed the merge on github and deleted the branch</p>
                <p>when i returned to my console i navigated back to the origin brach and used a pull command</p>
                <quote>"git checkout master" <br> "git pull"</quote>
