        <h2>What did i learn today?</h2>
        <p>firstly i learned an easy way to test the responsiveness of my website</p>
        <p>by using the inspect tool on a live server of my page i could toggle devices or manually set the width and
            height</p>
        <figure>
            <img id="responsive" src="responsive.jpg" alt="a drop-down box to select popular devices">
            <figcaption>The picture shows a vareity of different devices that can be selected or a manual imput for
                width and height</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>i noticed that below a certain width my Nav bar would start to overlap and become distorted</p>
        <figure>
            <img id="unresponsive" src="unresponsive.jpg" alt="the buttons for the nav bar overlap">
            <figcaption>The picture shows a Nav bar on a smaller screen where the buttons start to overlap each other
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>i raised this in a buddy meeting as an issue i was working on and was directed to <quote>media querys</quote>
        </p>
        <a href="https://mediag.com/blog/popular-screen-resolutions-designing-for-all/" target="_blank"
            alt="a site with popular screen sizes">I used this site
            for reference on screen sizes</a>
        <p>the code i created was this:</p>
        <br>
        <quote>
            @media (max-width: 479px) { <br>
            nav ul li { <br>
            display: block; } <br>
            }</quote>
        <p>this would convert my display from inline to block so that the buttons stack on top of each other on a
            smaller screen width</p>
        <figure>
            <img id="displayBlock" src="display-block.jpg" alt="displays nav buttons stacked on top of each">
            <figcaption>The image shows a smaller screen width in which all the nav buttons are stacked on top of each
                other in their own line instead of overlapping as before</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
    <script src="/main.js" async defer></script>
