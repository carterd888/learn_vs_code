        <h2>What did i learn today?</h2>
        <p>today i continued my progress with yesterdays project on my own</p>
        <p>i continued to follow the steps in the tutorial</p>
        <a href="https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/812093" target="_blank" alt="openprocessing tutorial">this is the
            guide we were
            given</a>
        <p>with some research i was able to complete the project, even using steps which were labeled as complex
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>the first thing i learned to do was to rotate my text</p>
        <p>this was more complex than it seems as it involved translating the position and then rotating it, and asking
            the code to remember the starting position and then forget the end position each time</p>
        <figure>
            <img id="pushPop" src="push-pop.jpg" alt="code used to rotate text">
            <figcaption>The image shows the code used to remember co-ordinates, move the text and then forget the new
                co-ordinates</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>push is used at the start to remember the position</p>
        <p>then translate moves the co-ordinates</p>
        <p>rotate is selecting the angle from my array in radians</p>
        <p>then when i write the word the co-ordinates are set at 0, 0</p>
        <p>pop is used to forget the new co-ordinates</p>
        <p>if push/pop are not used then the new position/angle will be used as the starting point each time</p>
        <hr>
        <p>the next thing i added to my project was the ability to refresh the drawing using the mouse</p>
        <p>the code is pretty simple and using the mousePressed function i added the in-buit function to redraw</p>
        <figure>
            <img id="mousePressed" src="mousePressed.jpg" alt="calls redraw inside mousePressed">
            <figcaption>The image shows the redraw function being called within mousePressed </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <hr>
        <p>lastly i added a function to save a screenshot of my poster</p>
        <p>i wanted the function to be called when a certain key of the keyboard is pressed, so i researched the
            keyPressed function</p>
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/keyPressed" target="_blank" alt="p5js reference on keypressed">i used
            this site to read
            how the function works</a>
        <p>which lead me to <a href="http://keycode.info/" target="_blank" alt="keycode.info">this site</a> to see which
            keycode each
            key on the keyboard represents</p>
        <figure>
            <img id="keyPressed" src="keyPressed.jpg" alt="uses the keycode P to save a screenshot">
            <figcaption>the image shows the keyPressed function being called if the P key is used</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>i used the function save and added the file name "MyPoster" so that if the "P" key is pressed a screenshot is
            taken and the file is called "MyPoster"</p>
        <figure>
            <img id="myPoster" src="myPoster.jpg" alt="shows a save file">
            <figcaption>shows a save file at the bottom of the screen named MyPoster</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>this function works best using google chrome</p>
        <hr>
        <p>my final poster screenshot generated by this code</p>
        <figure>
            <img id="screenshot" src="MyPoster (4).png" alt="my random word code">
            <figcaption>The image shows my randomly generated display made up of names from my buddy group</figcaption>
        </figure>
