        <h2>What did i learn today?</h2>
        <p>after discussing flexbox yesterday in class, we were given the task to complete a game using flexbox
            terminology</p>
        <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">This is the site for the game</a>
        <p>i was able to complete most of the levels without much difficulty, however i was stuck on the final level</p>
        <figure>
            <img class="froggy" src="froggyStart.jpg" alt="level 24 start">
            <figcaption>The image shows the starting position of frogs in a row at the top and their lillypads down each
                side of the pond</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>i started by changing the flex-direction to a column in reverse order</p>
        <figure>
            <img class="froggy" src="froggy1.jpg" alt="level 24 incomplete">
            <figcaption>The image shows the frogs in a column but not lined up with the lillypads
                down each
                side of the pond</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>i then added wrap-reverse so that first two yellow frogs appear on the first column</p>
        <figure>
            <img class="froggy" src="froggy2.jpg" alt="level 24 incomplete">
            <figcaption>The image shows the frogs in two column but not lined up with the lillypads
                down each
                side of the pond</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>i then shortened this to flex-flow</p>
        <figure>
            <img class="froggy" src="froggy3.jpg" alt="level 24 incomplete">
            <figcaption>The image shows the frogs in two column but not lined up with the lillypads
                down each
                side of the pond using only 1 line of code</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>next i aligned the content with space-between so that they were against the sides of the pond</p>
        <figure>
            <img class="froggy" src="froggyStuck.jpg" alt="level 24 incomplete">
            <figcaption>The image shows 2 lines of code which nearly fulfill the requirements of the level however the
                yellow frogs on the left are not aligned on their lillypads </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>to resolve this next step i thought i should select just the yellow frogs and manually adjust the order</p>
        <p>this did not work as there was only the option to select the pond as a whole</p>
        <p>eventually i came to the realisation that by centering the frogs they would line up differently on each side
            of the pond due to the number of frogs.</p>
        <figure>
            <img class="froggy" src="froggySolved.jpg" alt="level 24 complete">
            <figcaption>The image shows all the frogs correctly lined up on their lillypads "level complete"
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>the final code i used was:</p>
        <code>" flex-flow: column-reverse wrap-reverse;<br>
            align-content: space-between;<br>   
            justify-content: center; "</code>
