        <h2>What did i learn today?</h2>
        <p>today i noticed a spelling mistake on my page title</p>
        <figure>
            <img id="spellingMistake" src="spelling-mistake.jpg" alt="page is called twelth not twelfth">
            <figcaption>the URL displays blog/twelth-entry which should be blog/twelfth-entry</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>while i was changing this i noticed that using this current indexing system not only are the names hard to
            read/spell they are also unordered within the blog directory</p>
        <figure>
            <img id="oldBlogListings" src="old-blog-listings.jpg" alt="the pages are showed in alphabetical order">
            <figcaption>the image shows the pages within the blog directory which are ordered alphabetically which does
                not correspond with the order they were created for example eleventh is before third</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>i proceeded to rename the pages using a numerical system starting with entry-1</p>
        <p>this was quite time consuming as i had to rename each folder, rename the title in the head tag and h1 tag.
            then rename both the previous and next links to reflect this name change</p>
        <p>the end result was a numerically ordered list which is much easier to read and impliment going forward</p>
        <figure>
            <img id="blogIndex" src="blog-index.jpg" alt="an ordered list">
            <figcaption>The image shows directories within blog starting at entry 1 and continuing in numerical order
            </figcaption>
