        <h2>What did i learn today?</h2>
        <p>Today i was researching Git and GitHub. i found a nice website that provides definitions of technical terms
        </p>
        <a href="http://www.techterms.com/definition/command_line_interface" target="_blank"
            alt="definitions of technical terms">Click Here for tech
            terms</a>
        <p>i also learned that a youtube informative video series from a programmer i enjoy has a series on Git and
            Github</p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY" target="_blank" alt="a video series on youtube">Click Here
            for code train youtube</a>
        <p>i watched the first video but will revisit the video playlist in the future when i have spare time</p>

            <figcaption>The image shows a screenshot of my answers to a Git quiz</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>what are the problems i encounterd and how did i resolve them?</h3>
        <p>the first problem i encountered today was that i had created a link to a website but when i viewed the live
            server code, the page was blank</p>
        <figure>
            <img id="sampleLink" src="sample-link.jpg" alt="snippet of code"><br>
            <figcaption>The image shows an anchor tag with no text to describe the link</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>i managed to solve this problem by visiting an existing web page i had used with a link and inspecting the
            code, it turns out i had not put what text to display in the link and also i could use another code in the
            link to ensure that it opens in a new web browser.</p>
        <p> next time i include a link i may look into the styling of the link with CSS</p>
        <br>
        <p>another problem i had was that my styling on a new index.html file was not displaying as intended</p>
        <figure>
            <img id="stylingErrorDisplay" src="styling-error-display.jpg" alt="preview of live code">
            <figcaption>The image shows the background colour at the top of screen but no styling around the text block
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>at first i thought my .css file was not referenced correctly, however the purple bar at the top of the screen
            suggested otherwise. on further inspection of my code i realised i had ended my div class as soon as i
            created it (due to me not wanted to forget to close it) and then i entered my code after i closed it.</p>
        <figure>
            <img id="stylingError" src="styling-error.jpg"
                alt="snippet of code showing two closing codes for div element">
            <figcaption>
                The image shows the div element is closed as soon as it has been opened, then is closed again at the end
                of the text. preventing any styling.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>after deleting the closing div tag at the start of my class the styling was added throughout.</p>
    </div>
