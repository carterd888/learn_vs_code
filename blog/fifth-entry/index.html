        <h2>What did i learn today?</h2>
        <p>Firstly after sharing this blog with my buddy group yesterday, i recieved feedback that the image was too big
            and could do with being made smaller. </p>
        <p>i initially decided to set a height and width for the image by defining an ID and setting pixel values using
            CSS</p>
        <p>this worked for the user who viewed using a web browser but it was still not displaying correctly on mobile
        </p>
        <p>i reasarched responsive sizing using CSS and found this example on <a
                href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_responsive.asp" target="_blank">w3 schools</a></p>
        <img id="responsive" src="responsive.jpg" alt="sample code using max-width: 100% and height: auto">
        <p>i then applied this to all images by using the element selector img</p>
        <hr>
        <p>another thing i discovered today was a site used for HTML markup validation</p>
        <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input" target="_blank">Link to site</a>
        <p>using this i was able to test my pages i had already created and was suprised to learn errors</p>
        <p>the first was that i had not defined a "lang" within the html tag. this was an oversight by me in that
            everything on my page is in english, so i assumed the page would be read in english. however it is best
            practise to define this.</p>
        <p>another error which the validator picked up is that many of my .jpg files had names containing spaces. while
            Visual Studio Code was able to read my sources references spaces due to the files being stored locally it is
            invalid syntax for a URL to contain a space</p>
        <p>as the files were on my local machine i had 2 options, either rename the files to not contain spaces, or to
            encode the spaces using %20</p>
        <p>i decided to do the former as Visual Studio Code offers shortcuts when referencing files and if i had to
            manually over-ride the url to encode the spaces it would defeat the purpose.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>lastly, i started work today on creating a website template using "dummy" text</p>
        <p>i focused on one of the steps “[website should include] An articles section with three articles, each
            including a title, summary and a link.”</p>
        <p>as i had previously used Emmet to create repetitive code with a single line of text, i set myself the
            challenge to optimise this.</p>
        <img id="attempt-1" src="attempt-1.jpg" alt="my first attempt at the code">
        <img id="attempt-2" src="attempt-2.jpg" alt="my second attempt at the code">
        <img id="attempt-3" src="attempt-3.jpg" alt="my third attempt at the code">
        <img id="attempt-4" src="attempt-4.jpg" alt="my fourth attempt at the code">
        <p>each time i was able to refine the string of code to include more detailed features</p>
        <p>i saved the final code used in comments on my page so that i can refer to it again in the future</p>
        <img id="final-attempt" src="final-attempt.jpg"
            alt="my final code: ”section#articles>(article>h2{article $}+h3{about article $}+p>lorem20^a)*3”">
