        <h2>What did i learn today?</h2>
        <p>Today i learned about CSS Selectors. We were given the task to read up on the subject and attempt to complete
            a game to test our knowledge.</p>
        <a href="https://flukeout.github.io/" target="_blank" alt="a CSS selector game">This is the Game</a>
        <p>I found this a very useful tool to apply my knowledge.</p>
        <p>One of the selectors i found challenging at first was the "*" selector used to select all, also known as
            "Universal Selector".</p>
        <p>It was using this in combination with other selectors, specifically the placement of the "*" in the selctor
            where i struggled.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img id="combine-universal" src="./combine-universal.jpg"
                alt="the game asks you to select everything on a plate and displays 4 objects 3 are plates of various styles">
            <figcaption>The image shows a level of the game where every object which is on a plate should be selected
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>I first tried to use "plate*",</p>
        <p>However this would be selecting the plates and not what is on the plates.</p>
        <p>So i had to use the parent selector ">".</p>
        <p>By combining the two as "plate>*" i was able to correctly selected every object that had the parent "plate".
